It is the **26th** devlog of **Rakugo Project**.
I'm happy to announce I finally ported Advanced Text addon to Godot 4.1.
Docs for this version are also ready.

I also have a great request that you consider the monetary support of the project trough
[Pateron] or [Itch.io], because I have recently had a big financial problems.

## What is Advanced Text

Extends RichTextLabel and adds support for Markdown and RenPy.
Our RenPy Markup and Markdown have some extra stuff so read docs to learn it.
This new version is designed in way so any one can crate its own TextParser to use with AdvancedText nodes.
