Hi everyone, welcome to **6st** devlog of **Rakugo Project** in year 2025.
Its devlog is in part overdue, sorry for that, but life happen.
So if you find my projects useful, please support financial project thought **[Patreon]**.
I really appreciate it, make less depressed and I will also be able to devote more time my projects!

## First 3D Rakugo game

On our [discord] user @Villagerjj boasts that he's creating a 3D game using our VisualNovelKit. 
Here's a short video of his game (WIP).

## Rakugo Dialogue System 2.2.2

### Major Updates

- Added RakuScript Colorizer addon - RakuScript Highlighter [#291]
- Added RakugoRegexLab addon - for easy testing regex for Rakugo[#291]

### Fixed Bugs

I Fixed bug that made unable tu turn on plugin in new Projects in Godot 4.4.1 or newer [#289]
Thanks for user @23BLUENINJA on discord and @Dhyoga on Github for reporting it.
We didn't find it ourself, as we only ported projects from 4.3 to 4.4.1 and didn't make new ones.
