Hi everyone, welcome to **8th** devlog of **Rakugo Project** in year 2024.
You can support of the project trough **[Patreon]**.

You're probably wondering what hasn't happened for so long, no news.
Maybe as some of you know I've already been hired by **ActZero**
to help them with their visual novel **[We. The Refugees]**.
They hired me to work on their new game again.
This is the main reason why I had to stop working on **VisualNovelKit**.
I know, I'll have to give you a hard time about it sooner.

They decided to use solutions from our team such as:

- Rakugo-Game-Template
- AdvancedText
- Emojis for Godot
- Godot Material Icons

I got the green light for them to use fixes
and features developed for them in OpenSource versions of this projects.
Soon there will be new releases of those projects !

Even more they decided to go with [Monologue] instead of ours [RDS],
but this turn out to be good for us.
Monologue is Visual Script tool for dialogues,
I got task to modify it to better suit their needs,
but also got green-light to use this modified version as base for
Rakugo Visual Script Tool.

In this Devlog:
