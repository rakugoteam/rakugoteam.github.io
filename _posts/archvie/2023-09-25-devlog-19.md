Hi everyone, here is the **19th** devlog of **Rakugo Project**.
I'm happy to announce that we fixed bugs that made Rakugo Dialogue System that made it incompatible with Godot 4.1.
And unified/fixed ask statements in Rakugo Dialogue System in code and our docs.

## Rakugo Dialogue System 2.1.1

complete changelog: https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/compare/2.1...2.1.1

### Major Updates
* fix #245 ask like doc by @theludovyc in https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/pull/250
> - Now ask is same as the one in the documention
>  `[var_name] = ? [character_tag] [question] [default_answer]`
> - Plus you can respect or not the number of space arround the '=' and '?'
> `answer = ? "question"` is correct
> `answer=?"question"` is also correct
> - But you should respect spaces between tag, question, and default answer
> `answer=?tag "question" "default answer"` is correct
> `answer=?tag"question""default answer"` is not

* fix #243 be threads safe by @theludovyc in https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/pull/252
> Now Rakugo is threads safe, and signals are called correctly. So you will not have errors in the last godot version (4.1).
