Hi everyone, here is the **14th** devlog of **Rakugo Project**.
Today we are releasing Rakugo Dialogue System 2.0.1 !

## Rakugo Dialogue System 2.0.1

So this is a fix update release, as we quickly realise that one of core features of it did't work at all.
This feature was possibility to add your own keywords to RakuScript using [regex](https://regexr.com).

[*More about regex in Godot you can read here.*](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_regex.html)

We also decided to renamed it form `parser_unhandled_regex` to `custom_regex` in both func and signal.
