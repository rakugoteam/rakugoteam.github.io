This update have some fixes and first Point&Click game feature.

## Why RC1?

Everything work as should I just marked it as _RC1_ because I started to working on new tutorial added to template.
That will be also a showcase of all features that will be in feature downloadable separately as exported exe or putted as HTML5 demo
to encourage more people to use it. But I don't have enough time finish it yet, so this is reason for _RC1_ in version.

## Fixed bugs:

- quitting froze game
- going further in dialogues sometimes doesn't work
- custom icons for Rakugo's nodes now works

## New features:

- added **MouseBody2D** node as work around for not working mouse input on Area2D
- added **AreaButton2D** (to be used with **MouseBody2D**) to easy crate clickable areas (like in point&click games)

[**Here is tutorial how to use this new features**](https://rakugodocs.readthedocs.io/en/3.2/tutorials/clickable_areas/)

### to make it easier to mix Rakugo with other game genres mechanics:

- now Rakugo attach current scene to Viewport
- now, by default, DialoguePanel is hidden until is called by Dialogue node

To update 3.2.0 unpack _Rakugo_3.2.1_update.zip_ and add _highlight_ to map inputs (to for example `F1` key).

To test _point_n_click_example.zip_ unpack it into Rakugo 3.2.1 project and play using _Play Scene_ option.
