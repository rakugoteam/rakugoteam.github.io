Hi everyone, welcome to **9th** devlog of **Rakugo Project** in year 2024.
If you find my projects useful, you can support the project via **[Patreon]**.
Thank you very much, if you decided to do!

## Incremental Releases and Updates

I recently realized that I was approaching Rakugo projects
and my other own projects come in a way that neither serves you.
Instead of staying under pressure to create their optimal version
with all the options I can think of, I switching into incremental releases/updates!

### What I understand as Incremental Releases/Updates
With this post I abandon this approach,
now I will try to release the minimum version of the project first,
then in subsequent updates I will add only a few new options and fixes.

You will soon see how it works as **Visual Novel Kit 2.0** will soon land here,
which is currently at the stage of implantation of the **Save/Load system**.

## Godot Icons Fonts

Projects **Godot Material Icons** and **Emojis for Godot**
soon will be combined into one project called **Godot Icons Fonts**.
Now I'm working on it, version 1.0 of this new project is almost ready,
I just need find way to fix one bug.

Why I'm combining those two projects, answer is simple.
They was almost the same code base, so it was every tedious to keep them both.
It also make easier for me to add new features or improve existing ones.

The main changes:
- New **FontIconSettings** resource
![](/images/icons-fonts/FontIconSettings.png)
- Better **FontIconButton** as now it can have label
![](/images/icons-fonts/IconButtons.png)
- Option do dock to Bottom IconsFinder

_See you next Week or Two._
