As you can see, this site now has new page called **Extensions/Addons**.

## Extensions and Addons

_Extensions_ are extensions to your Rakugo project.
They are meant to be modified however you want to fit your project.
_Addons_ are addons for Godot which expand Rakugo functionality.
I decided to call them this way to make
a distinction between these two types of addons.
For now, I plan to make extension _Click & Point Adventure_.
I will also release _Graphic Editor Dialog_ as an addon.
However, before that I need to change/add few things in Rakugo itself.

## Rakugo RPG

It adds:

- **RPGCharacter** - extension of **Character** Node
- **Combat System**
- **Example assets from GDQuest's godot-open-rpg**

## What about other RPG mechanics

- *Quest System* is already part of Rakugo
- Other rpg machanics will be added in next updates of this extension

## How To install

- First you need [Rakugo 2.1.05](/news/devlog/rakugo-2.1.05/)
- Unpack zip to _res://game_ folder
- Start modifying it to fit your game
- Once you have incorporated the extension, you can remove the example asset folder

## How I can modify

### Here I will put video tutorial soon
