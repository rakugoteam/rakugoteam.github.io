## Changes

- Fixes for **RPG Game Kit**
- Fix `RakugoRangeVar` - now works as intended
- Made `RakugoTextLabel` preview works in editor (shown in the screenshot)
- Change text passer to Singleton to make ⬆️ above possible
- Add `DELIVERED_STATE` to quest states
- Add `icon` value to `CharacterObj` - not useful yet
- Add new flag `Rakugo.can_save` - allow to turn on/off save and auto-save features.
- Add flag `Rakugo.can_show_in_game_gui`
- Better working `Rakugo.show("InGameGUI")` now works only if `Rakugo.can_show_in_game_gui = true`
- Fixes in Rakugo **Project Settings tab**
- Better code in _gui/Screens/Screens.tscn_

## How To Update

*Unfortunately for Rakugo, the automatic adding of singletons doesn't work.*

1. You need to delete all Rakugo files except the game folder
2. Then copy the file from the new Rakugo version to your project
