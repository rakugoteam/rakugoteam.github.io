Hi everyone, here is the second devlog of **Rakugo 3.3**.

Now I see that new Rakugo release won't be ready in this month, but if everything goes as planed then it will ready in next month.

In this devlog, I will talk about last changes in Rakugo, new ideas and *theLudovyc* joining the team. 
*theLudovyc* will help me with the development of **Rakugo** and will develop visual scripting plugin for Rakugo dialogue-system.

## theLudovyc joins the team

Few words from *[theLudovyc]*, who is now a member of the team:
> Hello everyone üòÑ !
> 
> I am developer for 10 years now. I discovered Godot few years ago and I created a French community around it. Not long ago, a member of my community used Dialogic and had few bugs. So to help him I dive into code. The worst I saw was the amount of disk-access. I made PR with refactor and talked with devs, but they didn‚Äôt want my help. So I created my own plugin [GDialog] based on it, with refactor and new things. Two weeks ago I saw a tweet of Jeremy saying he wanted help. I offered my help and he said yes! Now we are working together on Rakugo and I‚Äôll help him to merge visual editor on it üòÉ.
>
> Have a good day !

theLudovyc find about that I need help thanks to this tweet:

## Kits

We decided that splitting **Rakugo** to separated plugins is a good idea.
*Rakugo Kits* will be a sets of **Rakugo + other addons + gui template + *project.godot*** file for given game genre:
- **Rakugo Visual Novel Kit** (Almost done)
- **Rakugo Adventure (Point'n'Click) Kit** (WIP Early)
- **Rakugo RPG Kit** (To Do)

Each Kit will have its own repository. 
Each GUI template will have its own repository.
Soon **Rakugo** will become a standalone **Godot** plugin with out included gui in new repo. And current **Rakugo** repo with gui for visual novel will become base for **Rakugo Visual Novel Kit**.

## AdvancedTextLabel

**RakugoTextLabel** was separated from **Rakugo** and turned into **AdvancedTextLabel** a part of ‚û°Ô∏è **[AdvancedText]** addon. 
It's a new node that will be used in for displaying text in **Rakugo's** GUI templates.

Its supports:
 - **Markdown**
 - **Ren'Py Markup Langue**
 - **BBCode**
 - **[Headers]** (ToDo)
 - **Emojis** if you have **[Emojis]** addon in project
 - **Loading text from file** (WIP)
 - **Variables in text from given Dictionary** (WIP)

About Markdown support: **AdvancedTextLabel** use **RichTextLabel** as base for it so we are limited by Godot's **BBCode** supports.
But Godot's **BBCode** also adds some non-standard stuff, like effect, so this **Markdown** is a bit different from standard ones.

Different to standard **Markdown**:
 - `<` and `>` is used to mark variable in text
 - only `*` is used for italic text as `_` is often used in **GDScript** variable names
 - [use **alt text** for image size]
 - [**CSS**-like tags for **BBCode**-only features]

Its adds adds:
 - **AdvancedTextLabel** (almost done)
 - **MarkupEdit** - extended version of **TextEdit**
 - **MarkupTextEditor**:
    - new editor mode
    - editing text in selected node (almost done)
    - editing text in text files (WIP)

**MarkupTextEditor** in action!
