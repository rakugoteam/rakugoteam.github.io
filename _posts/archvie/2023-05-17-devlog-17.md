Hi everyone, here is the **17th** devlog of **Rakugo Project**.
First we want to thank our discord user **paperjack** for reporting a bug in Rakugo Dialogue System.
His game *"Elfindor destroys EVIL"* is image header of this post.
This bug made that in our RakuScript language any mistake in indentation or space at end of line would make the script not work.
Errors like this are hard to find in scripts so we make that now our parser will don't care if indentation is mixed and spaces at end of line.
From now blocks are ended by empty lines and not by indentation.

He also reported that there is missing example of Menu in RakuScript and its syntax explanation in our documentation.
[Now this is fixed and you can find it in our documentation.](https://rakugoteam.github.io/rakugo-docs/2.1/rakuscript/#menu)

There is many other changes in this release like comment-lines `#` in RakuScript or `game_loaded` signal, you can find them in our changelog below.

## Whats Next?

First we want to try to backport some of this changes to Rakugo Dialogue System 1.x branch for Godot 3.4(or higher) users.
We are working on Rakugo Dialogue System 2.2, we want to add more features to RakuScript and improve our documentation.
Our biggest focus is improve Rakugo Vars in RakuScript, as now without using `custom_regex` you can't easy modify Rakugo Vars in RakuScript.
Also now they only support `int`, `float` and `string` types, we want to add more types.

This is all for now, see you in the next devlog!
