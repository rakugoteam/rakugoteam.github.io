## RakuDialogueUI

Is our new project that allow you to just Drag&Drop Dialogue UI to scene when you want to has dialogue in and it will just works.
We plan to give different modules to it so for example it one module can add to it portrait like in final fantasy, other one bubbles, etc.
It will allow us to have a one UI base for all our Kits which will speed up the development of feature Kits.
This new project Repo is [here](https://github.com/rakugoteam/RakuDialogueUI)

We have few ideas of our own for this scripting language, 
but we need your opinion, as we are not sure if we should implement them or not.
