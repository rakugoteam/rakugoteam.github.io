## Version Numbering System Changed

Originally, version 2.1.00 was supposed to give the opportunity to create adventure games (point & click) in addition to visual novel games. But the changes that I made now are quite big, in particular the fact that the large GUI now uses its own viewport to display scene - it will facilitate the creation of games from genres other than visual novel with Rakugo. I also changed version numbering to 4 digits, which will be useful because I have an idea for a lot of small improvements graphical tools. The previous version 2.1.0 now becomes version 2.2.00.
