Hi everyone, here is the **8th** devlog of **Rakugo Project 3.3**.
We are happy to 1th release of **Rakugo Core**.
After 10 months of development it is finaly here !
You can [download it here](/addons/rakugo-core) **Now link is fixed!**, 
To show you how it is simple to use it **theludovyc** created a simple example project for you.

![](https://github.com/rakugoteam/RDS-Examples/raw/godot-4/stevepixelface_dialog_system/stevepixelface_dialog_system.png)

This example project is based on [assets and scripts](https://github.com/stevepixelface/dialog-system) from YouTube tutorial by 
[Steve Pixelface about creating Dialog System in Godot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur9j3c5_of0).

Example can be [download here](/examples/steve-pixelface)

#### Major Updates
* New save system #58 by @theludovyc in <https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/pull/59>
* Save in one file, Create Rakugo TestSaveLoad, Remove TestStoreManager by @theludovyc in<https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/pull/125>

Before, StoreManager was a script on a Node in Rakugo scene and save data was stored in .tres file. Now it's a class instantiated by Rakugo script and data are stored in one json file. It path is user://save_name/save.json. Data are variables and characters.
Methods was created to interact with StoreManager too.

See : [Rakugo.set_variable(...)](https://rakugoteam.github.io/rakugo-docs/rakugo_singleton/#set_variable), [Rakugo.get_variable(...)](https://rakugoteam.github.io/rakugo-docs/rakugo_singleton/#get_variable), [Rakugo.define_character(...)](https://rakugoteam.github.io/rakugo-docs/rakugo_singleton/#define_character), [Rakugo.save_game(...)](https://rakugoteam.github.io/rakugo-docs/rakugo_singleton/#save_game), [Rakugo.load_game(...)](https://rakugoteam.github.io/rakugo-docs/rakugo_singleton/#load_game)

* Refactor Character by @theludovyc in<https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/pull/83>

Before, Character was a Godot's resource. Now they are dictionaries can contains character's variables. It's StoreManager handles them, store and load from save too.

See : [Rakugo.get_character(...)](https://rakugoteam.github.io/rakugo-docs/rakugo_singleton/#get_character)

* now can create/set variables in rkscript by @theludovyc in<https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/pull/75>
* Set variable cast #91 by @theludovyc in<https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/pull/94>
* Add TestVariable, funcs set and get handle character's variable by @theludovyc in<https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/pull/98>
* Throw Errors by @theludovyc in<https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/pull/89>

Now you can create or set variables from RakuScript. It calls Rakugo.set_variable(...) and Rakugo.get_variable(...). They are also typed. A simple check to see if they can be an integer, float, or a string. A good change is Rakugo.set_variable(...) and Rakugo.get_variable can handle global variables and character's variables too. They are also throw error if variable or character does not exist and you try access them.

See : [RakuScript Variables](https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/wiki/RakuScript#variable), [RakuScript Character's Variables](https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/wiki/RakuScript#characters-variable), [Rakugo.set_variable(...)](https://rakugoteam.github.io/rakugo-docs/rakugo_singleton/#set_variable), [Rakugo.get_variable(...)](https://rakugoteam.github.io/rakugo-docs/rakugo_singleton/#get_variable)

* Super say by @theludovyc in<https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/pull/87>

Now you can use variable inside a say instruction in RakuScript.

See : [RakuScript Say](https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/wiki/RakuScript#say)

* Jump if #81 by @theludovyc in<https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/pull/100>

It's an update of Jump instruction in RakuScript. Now you can jump only if an condition is true.

See : [RakuScript JumpIf](https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/wiki/RakuScript#jump-if)

* Rework rakugo parser #84 by @theludovyc in<https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/pull/118>
* do_parse_script, do_execute_script, return error by @theludovyc in<https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/pull/108>
* Start execute script from a label #68 by @theludovyc in<https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/pull/135>

Before, script are just parsed and executed at same time. Now you can store them and execute them when you want. Methods also returns error if script file does not found, or have parse errors, ... New things too, you can start a script not always at beginning, but from a label.

See : [Rakugo.parse_script(...)](https://rakugoteam.github.io/rakugo-docs/rakugo_singleton/#parse_script), [Rakugo.execute_script(...)](https://rakugoteam.github.io/rakugo-docs/rakugo_singleton/#execute_script), [Rakugo.parse_and_execute_script(...)](https://rakugoteam.github.io/rakugo-docs/rakugo_singleton/#parse_and_execute_script)

* Emit a signal when script execution is finished #130 by @theludovyc in<https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/pull/132>

Now Rakugo send a signal when script execution is finished.

See : [Rakugo script_execution_is_finished](https://rakugoteam.github.io/rakugo-docs/rakugo_singleton/#script_execution_is_finished)

## RakuDialogueUI

Is our new project that allow you to just Drag&Drop Dialogue UI to scene when you want to has dialogue in and it will just works.
We plan to give different modules to it so for example it one module can add to it portrait like in final fantasy, other one bubbles, etc.
It will allow us to have a one UI base for all our Kits which will speed up the development of feature Kits.
This new project Repo is [here](https://github.com/rakugoteam/RakuDialogueUI)

### We want to know your opinion 

We have few ideas of our own for this scripting language, 
but we need your opinion, as we are not sure if we should implement them or not.
