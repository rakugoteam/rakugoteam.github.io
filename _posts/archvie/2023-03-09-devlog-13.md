Hi everyone, here is the **13th** devlog of **Rakugo Project**.
Today we are releasing Rakugo Dialogue System 2.0 for Godot 4.0!

Join our [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/rakguoteam) to support us!

## Rakugo Dialogue System 2.0 for Godot 4.0

You may ask what is *"Rakugo Dialogue System"*? And where is *"Rakugo (Core)"*?
So we decided to rename "Rakugo (Core)" to Rakugo Dialogue System, because it is more descriptive.
New repo url is : <https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System>

## Update from Godot 3.X to 4.X

Make updating your project from Godot 3.X to 4.X easier, we kept the same addon name and paths the same.
As for now in Godot 4.0 changing names of files/folders is broken.
Signal system have changed. So we renamed all *"Rakugo Dialogue System"* signals.
Just add `sg_` at begining. Like `old_signal_name` to `sg_old_signal_name`.
Everything else is the same.

You can download new version here: <https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/releases/latest>

This is all for today. See you next time!
