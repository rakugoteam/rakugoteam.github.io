Hi everyone, here is the **20th** devlog of **Rakugo Project**.
I'm happy to announce that we add huge new features in RakuScript this release including:
- now is possible to use double quotes inside strings example: `"it is a "really" good one"`
- using assignment operators like: =, +=, -=, *=, /=
- using variables in any string: say, ask, menu and for variables

# Rakugo Dialogue System 2.2
**Full Changelog**: <https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/compare/2.1.1...2.2>

## Strings 
### Using double quotes

Like the title says, you can do that now `"it is a "really" good one"`

*Added with [#257](https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/issues/257) use double quotes inside strings by @theludovyc in [#261](https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/issues/261)*

### Variables inside strings

The big update of this version ! You can now use variables inside any strings, for say, ask questions and ask variable, menu choices and for variables !
```renpy
# example
player.life_str = "You have <player.life> life points left"
```

A very important thing: string is replaced with a value **when you use/read it**, not on assignment.
```renpy
# example
player.life = 10
player.life_str = "You have <player.life> life points left"
player.life = 5
narrator "<player.life_str>"
```
The narrator will say: *"You have 5 life points left"*.

```gdscript
# example
Rakugo.get_variable("<player.life_str>")
Rakugo.get_variable("player.life_str")
# both returns "You have 5 life points left"
```

We took advantage of this to let you a new Rakugo method `replace_variables(text:String)`.
```gdscript
# example
Rakugo.replace_variables("You have <player.lifelife points left")
# will return: "You have 5 life points left"
```

*Added with [#255](https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/issues/255) Use variables inside any strings by @Jeremi360 in [#256](https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/pull/256)*

## Handle common operators for variable assignment

Another big update! You can use assignment operators like: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=` to assign a value to a variable.
Before that you could only use `=` - it allowed only to overwrite variables values.
Example: `gd.bugs -= 1`
We would like to handle expressions for the v2.3 (example: damage = dps + boost + 1)

*Added with [#262](https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/issues/262) Handle common operators for variable assignment by @theludovyc in [#263](https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/pull/263)*

## HTML5 export now works on itch.io with firefox

Some time ago Rakugo wasn't working on itch.io with firefox for html5 export, because we use multi-threading feature. 
it wasn't handled on this website. It is now resolved !

*Fixed by [#52](https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/issues/52) Rakugo not works on itch.io with firefox*

You can see my @theludovyc post here <https://itch.io/post/5713938>, and the main one <https://itch.io/t/2025776/experimental-sharedarraybuffer-support>.

So you have just one thing to remember when you export now, is to not forget to add your `.*rk` files [rakugo-docs/2.1/export](https://rakugoteam.github.io/rakugo-docs/2.1/export/)

### Fixed Bugs
* fix [#49](https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/issues/49) handle escape characters by @theludovyc in [#254](https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/pull/254)
* hotfix for menu index out of range by @theludovyc in [#258](https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/pull/258)

### Other Changes
* hotfix remove prints in Parser.gd by @theludovyc in [#253](https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/pull/253)
* fix [#259](https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/issues/259) remove warning in get_character by @theludovyc in [#260](https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/pull/260)
* Bump version to 2.2, clean up rakugo dir from git config files by @Jeremi360 in [#267](https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/pull/267)
