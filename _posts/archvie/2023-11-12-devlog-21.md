Hi everyone, here is the **21th** devlog of **Rakugo Project**.
I'm happy to announce that we have huge new update of Emojis-For-Godot addon.

![addon-in-action]

## Google Noto Emojis Color font
Now it uses [Google Noto Emojis Color font][Noto Emoji Color]
which makes addon smaller, faster and easier to update and develop.
Before this it was using texture atlas for emojis.

## Database Updated using python
Now it uses [json data generated using python][Python script]
which makes addon easier to update in feature.

## Refreshed Emoji Finder
**Emoji Finder** was rewritten using code form [Godot Material Icons] **Icon Finder** as it base.
