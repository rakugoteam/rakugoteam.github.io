This is fix release.
Sorry I foucs to much on making new docs for Rakugo.
And don't test Rakugo enough after the last changes.
Atlas textures doesn't works with godot classes,
so I revert to normal icons for Rakugo Nodes.
Also I forgot to test *The Question* - and testing it help me fixes some other 3 small bugs.
So I start working on **Testing-Kit** for Rakugo to make testing feature realses of Rakugo easier for me.
