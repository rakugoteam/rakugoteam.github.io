Hi everyone, here is the **12th** devlog of **Rakugo Project**.
This devlog is about new releases of both Rakugo Core and Advanced Text, 
but also how we changed `show`/`hide` feature in VisualNovelKit.

## Changes to VisualNovelKit show/hide feature

If you read previous devlog you will remember that I wanted to crate tool to crate special groups for that.
After few try attempts and a lot of thinking I realised that I overthinked my attempt to `show` and `hide` keywords in RakuScript
Instead of UI tool and crating strange groups using it, I will just have 3 new nodes **LayerUI**(I not sure of this name yet), **Layer2D** and **Layer3D**.
And here is working `show` keyword with **Layer2D** node.

And here is how the hierarchy of such a scene using **Layer2D** like looks in editor.
*Miho is a **Layer2D** its child can be any Node2D*

So to use `show` and `hide` keywords you need to create **Layer2D**  node with right name and add your 2D nodes to it.
Analogy with **Layer3D** with use *Spatial* nodes and **LayerUI** with use *Control* nodes.

## Rakugo Core 1.2

### Major Updates

* Add variable_changed and character_variable_changed signals by @Jeremi360 in https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/pull/165
  
  > Now when a variable is set, signals are emitted :
  > variable_changed(var_name, value) or
  > character_variable_changed(character_tag, var_name, value)

* prepare to replace `character_exists()` by `has_character()` by @Jeremi360 in https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/pull/170
  
  > character_exists() will be removed and replace by has_character(). Send a warning when character_exists() is used.

* Fix #93 : Now variable name can be one letter long by @theludovyc in https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/pull/179

* Fix #149 : Parser, add error when line is not handled. by @theludovyc in https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/pull/183
  
  > Now when you parse a script and a line can not be read, it send an error.

* Fix #156 : Executer, handle errors by @theludovyc in https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/pull/185
  
  > Add parameter error_str in signal execute_script_finished. If is empty no error, else contain error string. It can be used to show it. Already used with push_error, so do not do it again !

* Fix #134 : Add Rakugo.stop_last_script by @theludovyc in https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/pull/186
  
  > Add Rakugo.stop_last_script() and not Rakugo.stop_script() or Rakugo.stop_script(script_name).
  > The last one need refactor before implement it. The second one is not enough explicit we think.
  > So we add first one because in our current philosophy we have : one thread at a time.
  > We need refactor to handles multiples threads at same time. Work for 1.3.

* Fix #190 : Update rakugo.has_variable by @theludovyc in https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/pull/194
  
  > Rakugo.has_variable can now handle character variable like get_variable

* Fix #88 : Save load thread by @theludovyc in https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/pull/191
  
  > Rakugo.save_game(), now save name of current executed script, plus last line read. So with
  > Rakugo.load_game(), now parse last executed script.
  > Rakugo.resume_loaded_script(), run last executed script.
  > 
  > We split load in 2 funcs. So you can call Rakugo.load_game(), to loads variables as usual and load your scenes with them. And after everything is ready, call Rakugo.execute_last_script().

* Fix #152 : Autoload Rakugo.gd by @theludovyc in https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System/pull/195
  
  > Autoload Rakugo.gd instead of Rakugo.tscn
  > Remove Rakugo.tscn
  > Maybe you need to disable/enable the plugin Rakugo
