## Highlights

### Upgrade Material Design Icons version

This issue was reported by user @aiaimimi0920 in [#16] - thanks you @aiaimimi0920.

Inspired how I made upgrade to **Emojis For Godot**,
Here I also crated python script for easier updating icons in next versions.

### Fix `[icon:name, size]`

`[icon:name]` - was working in text, but `[icon:name, size]` didn't work at all.
So it wasn't possible to change icon size in text. But now this is working again.

### Added documentation comments

Now for both nodes MaterialIcon and MaterialButton are available docs in godot.
Due to godot docs be limited only to gdscripts and text we also made [online docs].

### Added links and button to online docs

Links to [online docs] are in MaterialIcon and MaterialButton docs,
but also you can click at button with `‚ùî` and it will open [online docs] in your browser.

_See you next Week._
