### Supported Markups

To all Markups **AdvancedText** adds:
- adds support for **Emojis-For-Godot** using `:emoji:` syntax
- adds support for variables in text using `<var_name>` syntax
  **;** our variables in text solution works even with:
  **Dictionary**, **Array**, **String** as array, **Color** and **Resource**. 

#### BBCode
The same as in build one in Godot, but with few extras:
- adds support for headers using `[H1] text [/H1]` syntax

#### Ren'Py markup
Has few changes to comparing to original one:
- for variables uses `<var_name>` instead of `[var_name]`
- adds support for headers using `{H1} text {/H1}` syntax
- adds support for all Godot **BBCode** tags just put them in `{}`

#### Markdown
**AdvancedTextLabel** uses **RichTextLabel** to render result so we just parse our markups to Godot BBCode so we need to change things.

Has few changes to comparing to standard one:
- `![height x width](path/to/img)` is used
- only ``` `code` ``` is used
- `@u { text }` is used for underline text
- `@tab { text }` is used for indent text
- `@tabel=cells { | cell1 | cell2 | }` is used for tables

But it also adds few features to our Markdown:
- `@color=color { text }` is used for coloring text
- `@center { text }` is used for centering text
- `@right { text }` is used for right aligning text
- `@fill { text }` is used for filling text
- `@effect args { text }` is used for effects on text

*This gif was made on Godot 3.4 version, maybe in newer version fade effect is fixed.*

## Godot MyST Docs Template

As ever of our projects will need a docs we made template to speed up setting them up.

- It uses **MyST** as parser for Markdown
- The same css as Godot Docs
- Support GDScript highlighting by the same plugin that Godot Docs uses

Ever one can use this template:

This is all for now.
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year Godotters!
