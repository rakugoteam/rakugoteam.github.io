## Here are new RakugoDocs

Now hosted on **ReadTheDocs** and use the same software as **GodotDocs**.

They use also [**MyST**](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io) so I can write it using **Markdown** instead of **reStructuredText**.
New docs uses more topic based approach similar too Ren'Py docs.

## "The Question" Patch

Our Discord server user _dBatareykin_ find out there was some bugs in _The Question_ and helped me fix them:

- fix Sylive sprites
- add missing `step()` in _book_ dialogue
- fix use of **ShowManager** and tags by **Label** node
- move setting `book` value to menu in _rightaway_ dialogue
- update menus ifs in dialogues
- Rakugo.StoreManager -> Rakugo.store
- fix bug that made `show("bg black")` stop the game.
