Hi everyone, here is the 3th devlog of **Rakugo 3.3**.
Now I see that new that I'm too optimistic about time 
when next version of Rakugo will be ready for release.
So now I yes it will be ready when it will be ready :smirk:.
For last 2 months I have been working on **AdvancedText** plugin for Godot and Rakugo.
**theLudovyc** has been working on **Rakugo**.
We also discovered some other plugins/tools for Godot that we will use for Rakugo.


## theLudovyc works on Rakugo core

Rakugo core is how we called Rakugo with out any plugins and gui.
We separated Rakugo core from Rakugo plugins and gui.
Now it is at [Rakugo repo](https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-Dialogue-System), previous Rakugo repo is now repo of [Visual Novel Kit](https://github.com/rakugoteam/VisualNovelKit).

Some words from *[theLudovyc]* about changes he made in Rakugo core:


## AdvancedText


## Discovered plugins/tools for Godot

### GDScriptify
[GDScriptify] by **hiulit** we probably will use it for **RakugoDocs**.

Is tool wrote in using node.js to generate Markdown docs from GDScript scripts.

From project ReadMe:
> A magical documentation tool for GDScript.
> # Introduction
> GDScriptify is an API documentation generator tool for GDScript that 
> converts comments you write alongside the code into Markdown documentation files.
>
> It's great for documenting Godot plugins or frameworks.
> Even for just  small one-script projects.

### GD-Plug
[GD-Plug] by **imjp94** we will use it to made updating of **Rakugo** Kits easier.

It allows to write script that will download/update all your addons/plugins in your Godot project, 
you do that using `plug("path/to/plugin/repo)` command.

From project ReadMe:
> Minimal plugin manager for Godot, inspired by vim-plug.
