Hi everyone, welcome to second devlog in year 2024,

I also have a great request that you consider the monetary support of the project trough

## Short aliases for emojis now are working again

That means that emojis for letters like üÖ∞Ô∏è, numbers 0Ô∏è‚É£ and sings #Ô∏è‚É£ are working again, and also that for some emojis you can use short names.

## Added documentation comments

Now for both nodes EmojiIcon and EmojiButton are available docs in godot.
Due to godot docs be limited only to gdscripts and text we also made [online docs].

## Added links and button to online docs

Links to [online docs] are in EmojiIcon and EmojiButton docs, but also you can click at button with `‚ùì` and it will open [online docs] in your browser.

_See you next Week._
