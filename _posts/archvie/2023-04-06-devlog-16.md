This bug made that is not possible to use non-string variables in `say` statement.
Now this is fixed for both Godot 3 and Godot 4 versions of Rakugo Dialogue System.
We also updated our [Steve Pixelface example](/examples/steve-pixelface) to the latest version of Rakugo Dialogue System.
And we started to work on some new examples for Rakugo Dialogue System more about this below.
