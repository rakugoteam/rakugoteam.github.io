Hi everyone, welcome to **7st** devlog of **Rakugo Project** in year 2025.
Its devlog is in part overdue, sorry for that, but life happen.
If you find my projects useful, please consider support and donate to project thought **[Patreon]**.
I really appreciate it, It will make me able to devote more of my time to this project.

## Sorry for long silence

I was quiet for a very long time and hardly made any updates on this project.
This is mainly because I have a new job related to Godot from 3 months, 
but not with Rakugo (and that's all I can say due to the NDA).
I haven't had a _"classic"_ job for a very long time, from _8-16_,
so it took me a long time to get used to it,
I had a hard time reconciling it with my hobby projects,
but I think I've figured it out, and Rakugo will launch in the new year.

## Rakugo Dialogue System, Visual Novel Kit and The Question fixed for Godot 4.4.1+
### Rakugo Dialogue System 2.2.2
- Added RakuScript Colorizer addon - RakuScript Highlighter [#291]
