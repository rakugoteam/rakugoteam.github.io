Hi everyone, welcome to first devlog in year 2024,
it is **22th** devlog of **Rakugo Project**.
I'm happy to announce that we have huge new update of online
[docs for RDS](https://rakugoteam.github.io/rakugo-docs/2.2/).

I also have a great request that you consider the monetary support of the project trough
[Pateron](https://www.patreon.com/rakguoteam) or [Itch.io](https://jeremi360x.itch.io/rakugo),
because I have recently had a big financial problems.

Then post begins a series of updates that will be posted weekly on Tuesdays, so see you next Tuesday.
