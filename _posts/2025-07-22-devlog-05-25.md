## RakuScript Colorizer

Its addon made by Saeiron, member of our community.
This addon adds option to Highlighting Syntax for RakuScript in Godot.
In near feature is will part of [RDS] repo and bundle with it in download.

We work on making it more automatic, but currently you must turn it once per _\*.rk_ file.
To turn it on open _\*.rk_ file in Godot Script Editor,
then menu **\*Edit > Syntax Highlighting > RakuScript**
