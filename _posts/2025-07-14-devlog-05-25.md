## VisualNovelKit Progress

I add working **History Log** in **Pause Menu**.

I fixed coloring Characters names in Dialogues

## RakuScript Colorizer

Its addon made by Saeiron, member of our community.

This addon adds option to Highlighting Syntax for RakuScript in Godot.
We work on making it more automatic, but currently you must turn it once per _\*.rk_ file.
To turn it on open _\*.rk_ file in Godot Script Editor,
then menu **\*Edit > Syntax Highlighting > RakuScript**

And now this RakuScript is in color
